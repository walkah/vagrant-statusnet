This is roughly the setup I use to do statusnet development - built with vagrant/chef.

 ## Installation
 
 * run vagrant up
 * clone statusnet into public/statusnet
 * install sites
 
 (more later)
 
 ## TODO
 
 * get activemq recipe enabling stomp by default (currently have to do that by hand).
 * prosody 
 * monit
